# rn-starter-kit
Yet another ReactNative boilerplate.
Contains:
- Native-base
- Realm
- Redux
- RN-Router-Flux

A scaffolding for main entry point for the app.
Scaffolding for realm models (with some draft of DTO and migrations).
Scaffolding for redux store.


Is more of a personal utility to quickstart new small projects.
